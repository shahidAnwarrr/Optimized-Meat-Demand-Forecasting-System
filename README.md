# Optimized Meat Demand Forecasting System

## Overview

The **Optimized Meat Demand Forecasting System** is a machine learning-based solution designed to help grocery store owners optimize their meat inventory management. Using historical sales data, the system forecasts future meat demandâ€”enabling better planning for orders, reducing losses from unsold stock, and ensuring adequate supply for customers.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Loads historical sales data from a CSV file.
  - Excludes the period from December 15, 2024, to December 25, 2024 (the Christmas season), to prevent this anomalous period from distorting the model.
  - Converts relevant columns to numeric types and handles categorical variables by creating dummy variables.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Creates binary features such as `open_next_day` based on the store's operating status.
  - Generates average price features across different meat types.
  - Constructs lag features (e.g., previous day's sales) to capture temporal dependencies.

- **Model Development:**
  - Trains a Random Forest regression model with hyperparameter tuning.
  - Uses Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to measure model performance.

- **Forecasting & Visualization:**
  - Implements a recursive forecasting strategy to generate daily predictions for future periods.
  - Provides a one-page Flask dashboard where clients can input forecast parameters (dates, planned price, average price).
  - Displays forecast results in both tabular and graphical formats, along with the current model accuracy (MAPE).
